# no-internet-detector
This is a basic chrome plugin which will inform you if you lose your internet connectivity on your machine. If you have this chrome plugin installed, when you lose your internet connection, a new chrome tab will be opened with the message saying "Oops, there is no internet connection available, try connecting again."
